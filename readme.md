# Plot scraper

Currently, plot scraper takes all functions defined in functions.txt and downloads their plot images with extremum points for WolframAlpha.
Images are downloaded into project's downloads folder and are not committed to repository.

NB! Plot scraper uses Selenium webdriver to scrape the images. Please make sure you have selected the proper driver according to you default web-browser

# Plan for future development

1. Generate/plan out at least 100 different functions.
2. Use CV to find extremum point coordinates in the images. 
3. Make script to generate function drawings without extremum points.
4. Generate some test data.
5. Do some AI magic!
